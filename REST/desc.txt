#REST = Representational State Transfer
    Rest is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints to be used for creating web services.

#CRUD (create, read, update, delete) Operations has some http requests :
    1--> GET = retrieves resources
    2--> POST = submits new data to the server
    3--> PUT = updates existing data
    4--> PATCH = update existing data partially
    5--> DELETE = removes data

#Creating RESTful APIs
    GET : /posts => to get data for all posts       (INDEX (main))
    POST : /posts => to add a new post      (CREATE)
    GET : /posts/:id => to get one post         (using id) (VIEW)
    PATCH : /posts/:id => to update specific post       (UPDATE)
    DELETE : /posts/:id => to delete specific post      (DESTROY)
